# Prompting Framework for Large Language Models using Llama2

Welcome to the Prompting Framework for Large Language Models using Llama2 repository! This framework aims to provide a flexible and efficient solution for generating prompts tailored specifically for Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging the powerful capabilities of Llama2.

## Overview
This project facilitates prompt generation and manipulation to optimize model performance across various tasks and domains. By integrating Llama2, a cutting-edge language model, we provide a robust framework for seamless integration with various LLM tasks such as text generation, classification, translation, and more.

## Features
- **Modular Prompt Generation**: Design prompts tailored to specific tasks or datasets using modular components.
- **Fine-tuned Prompt Optimization**: Implement advanced techniques to fine-tune prompts for enhanced model performance.
- **Dynamic Prompt Adjustment**: Allow for dynamic adjustment of prompts based on model feedback and performance metrics.
- **Task-Agnostic Prompting**: Enable seamless integration with various LLM tasks such as text generation, classification, translation, and more.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale efficiently for large datasets and high-volume inference tasks.

## Usage
- **Configuratio**n: Customize prompt generation and optimization settings according to your specific requirements.
- **Integration**: Integrate the prompting framework into your existing LLM pipeline or use it as a standalone tool for prompt generation.
- **Fine-tuning**: Experiment with different prompt configurations and fine-tuning strategies to optimize model performance.

## Installation
To get started with the framework, clone this repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This project utilizes Nvidia's CUDA technology for speeding up the process of learning. Make sure you have CUDA installed on your system. If not, download and install the CUDA Toolkit from the Nvidia website. Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary GPU drivers and CUDA-compatible hardware for optimal performance.

## Structure

- `llama_2_working.py`: Main Python script utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library to interact with the Llama-2 language model for generating responses based on a prompt.
- `pdf_extraction.py`: This Python script utilizes the PyPDF2 library to extract text from a PDF file.
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing an overview of the project.

- `app.py`: Flask application serves as a framework for generating responses using the Llama-2 language model based on prompts provided by the user. 
- `index.html`: HTML template provides a simple form for users to upload a PDF file and enter a prompt. 
- `result.html`: HTML template provides a simple layout to display the response generated by the Flask application.
