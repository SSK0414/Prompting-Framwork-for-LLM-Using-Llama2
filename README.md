#Prompting Framework for Large Language Models using Llama2

Overview

This project aims to provide a robust and flexible prompting framework tailored specifically for Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging the powerful capabilities of Llama2. By integrating Llama2, a cutting-edge language model, we aim to facilitate efficient generation and manipulation of prompts to optimize model performance across various tasks and domains.

Features

Modular Prompt Generation: Design prompts tailored to specific tasks or datasets using modular components.
Fine-tuned Prompt Optimization: Implement advanced techniques to fine-tune prompts for enhanced model performance.
Dynamic Prompt Adjustment: Allow for dynamic adjustment of prompts based on model feedback and performance metrics.
Task-Agnostic Prompting: Enable seamless integration with various LLM tasks such as text generation, classification, translation, and more.
Scalability: Designed to scale efficiently for large datasets and high-volume inference tasks.
Usage

Installation: Clone the repository and install dependencies using the provided setup script.
Configuration: Customize prompt generation and optimization settings according to your specific requirements.
Integration: Integrate the prompting framework into your existing LLM pipeline or use it as a standalone tool for prompt generation.
Fine-tuning: Experiment with different prompt configurations and fine-tuning strategies to optimize model performance.
