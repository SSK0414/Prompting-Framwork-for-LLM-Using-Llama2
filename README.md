# Prompting Framework for Large Language Models using Llama2

Welcome to the Prompting Framework for Large Language Models using Llama2 repository! This framework aims to provide a flexible and efficient solution for generating prompts tailored specifically for Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging the powerful capabilities of Llama2.

## Overview
This project facilitates prompt generation and manipulation to optimize model performance across various tasks and domains. By integrating Llama2, a cutting-edge language model, we provide a robust framework for seamless integration with various LLM tasks such as text generation, classification, translation, and more.

## Features
- **Modular Prompt Generation**: Design prompts tailored to specific tasks or datasets using modular components.
- **Fine-tuned Prompt Optimization**: Implement advanced techniques to fine-tune prompts for enhanced model performance.
- **Dynamic Prompt Adjustment**: Allow for dynamic adjustment of prompts based on model feedback and performance metrics.
- **Task-Agnostic Prompting**: Enable seamless integration with various LLM tasks such as text generation, classification, translation, and more.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale efficiently for large datasets and high-volume inference tasks.

## Usage
- **Configuratio**n: Customize prompt generation and optimization settings according to your specific requirements.
- **Integration**: Integrate the prompting framework into your existing LLM pipeline or use it as a standalone tool for prompt generation.
- **Fine-tuning**: Experiment with different prompt configurations and fine-tuning strategies to optimize model performance.
